## Executive Summary

AB Inc is a consumer wellness company seeking $10M in growth capital ($5M debt, $5M equity) at a $100M post-money valuation. The company operates two main product lines: FasciaBlaster (e-commerce wellness products) and Nexcia (FDA-cleared medical devices).

| **Market Risk** | 5/10 | Wellness/medical device markets proven but competitive |

---

## Red Flags & Concerns

### 1. Extremely Aggressive Projections
- **Year 1 revenue of $84.5M** requires immediate scale-up
- **Nexcia at $67.4M Year 1** with FDA clearance still pending
- **365-403% IRR** is venture outlier territory

### 2. Valuation Concerns
- **16.85x EV/EBITDA** is high for consumer goods (typical 8-12x)
- **$100M post-money** with limited current revenue data provided
- Exit assumptions require near-perfect execution

### 3. Capital Structure
- **$2M of Year 1 funds** go to repaying existing debt (20% of raise)
- Existing LOC/loans suggest cash flow challenges
- Debt + equity mix indicates risk tolerance

### 4. Missing Information
- Current revenue and EBITDA baseline not provided
- Customer acquisition costs not detailed
- Competitive positioning unclear
- Team/management background absent
- Historical financials missing

### 5. Execution Dependencies
- FDA clearance for Nexcia products
- US manufacturing ramp (tariff assumption of 30%)
- Retail channel expansion
- Gross margin improvements of 6%

---

## Key Strengths

1. **Diversified Revenue Streams** - E-commerce, medical devices, retail, international
2. **US Manufacturing Strategy** - Tariff avoidance could provide 30%+ margin benefit
3. **Quick Breakeven** - All initiatives claim <1 year payback
4. **Strong DSCR** - Debt service coverage ratios of 9-57x indicate cash generation
5. **Multiple Growth Levers** - Retail, international, new products

## Investment Recommendation

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Valuation** | $100M post with unvalidated projections - **Aggressive** |
| **Return Profile** | 365-403% IRR - **Unrealistic without validation** |
| **Risk/Reward** | High risk; projections need significant haircut |
| **Structure** | 50/50 debt/equity - Unusual for growth equity |

### Verdict: **PASS (Conditional on Diligence)**

**Rationale:** The projections are extraordinarily aggressive and lack baseline validation. Key concerns:

1. **Year 1 revenue assumptions** appear disconnected from typical ramp curves
2. **Nexcia FDA dependency** creates binary risk
3. **16.85x exit multiple** is optimistic for the sector
4. **Existing debt refinancing** suggests operational challenges

**If Proceeding:**
- Request 3 years of historical financials
- Validate current revenue run rate
- Haircut projections by 50-70%
- Negotiate valuation to $40-60M post-money
- Structure with milestones and tranched funding
- Require board seat and enhanced governance rights
