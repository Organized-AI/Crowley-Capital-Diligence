## Challenge: Limited Angel Fit for $10M Raise

### Analysis
AB Inc is seeking $10M total ($5M debt + $5M equity). Most angel networks in the Phalanx database max out at $500K-$2M checks. This creates a structural challenge:

| Check Size Bucket | Investors Available | % of Database |
|-------------------|---------------------|---------------|
| $5M+ | 3 | 4% |
| $1M-$5M | 8 | 11% |
| $500K-$1M | 12 | 16% |
| <$500K | 53 | 69% |

### Recommendation
For a $10M raise, AB Inc should consider:

1. **Syndicate Structure** - Lead investor + 5-10 angel participants
2. **VC Outreach** - Growth-stage VCs specializing in consumer/healthcare
3. **Strategic Investors** - CPG corporations, medical device companies
4. **Debt Providers** - Revenue-based financing for the $5M debt portion

## Investors NOT Matched (Key Exclusions)

| Investor | Reason for Exclusion |
|----------|---------------------|
| 10X Venture Partners | SaaS/marketplace focus only |
| Climate Insiders | Climate tech focus only |
| Ace of Cups | Drinks industry only |
| Allied Venture Partners | Excludes Healthcare/Medtech |
| Ante-Bellum Angels | Defense startups only |
| BADideas.fund | CEE B2B SaaS focus |
| CivilizationX | AI infrastructure only |

## Comparison: AB Inc vs StartBid Investor Fit

| Metric | AB Inc | StartBid |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **Top Match Score** | 0.89 | 0.91 |
| **Investors >0.75** | 9 | 10 |
| **Best Check Fit** | 1 4 All Group ($14M) | 1 4 All Group ($14M) |
| **Industry Alignment** | Healthcare/Consumer (Medium) | Marketplace/SaaS (High) |
| **Geographic Fit** | USA (High) | USA (High) |
| **Stage Fit** | Growth/Scaling (Good) | Seed (Excellent) |

**Key Insight:** StartBid has slightly stronger investor fit due to the prevalence of marketplace/SaaS-focused angels in the database. AB Inc's healthcare/consumer goods positioning has fewer dedicated investors in the Phalanx network.
