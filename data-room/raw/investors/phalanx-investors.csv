At Couchpotato, we believe that exceptional founders are the driving force behind transformative companies. Our mission is to empower ambitious entrepreneurs by providing patient capital and hands-on support in the earliest stages of startup journeys.

We invest pre-seed and seed, writing $100K checks as a founder's first outside capital. This enables entrepreneurs to get started and gain momentum without substantial dilution.

In addition to flexible financing, we take an active role in helping de-risk the startup process. Our team of experienced operators advises on growth, product-market fit, hiring key roles, forming partnerships, and raising future rounds.

We leverage our network to connect portfolio companies with advisors, customers, technical talent and follow-on investors. By sharing playbooks and facilitating pilot projects, we help founders avoid common pitfalls.

Our ideal founders are relentless learners who demonstrate grit, creativity and vision. We believe diverse, well-rounded teams outperform those with narrow expertise. Founders we back question assumptions, communicate effectively, and balance passion with pragmatism.

We designed Couchpotato to provide maximum autonomy with accountability. Our founder-friendly terms empower startups to take risks and maintain control. We drive alignment through transparency and only succeed when our portfolio succeeds.

If you are an ambitious innovator ready to take the leap, we want to fund you on your journey. Let’s build the future together, $100K check at a time.",Angel network,"$10,000","$100,000"
